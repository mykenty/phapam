# Page Enhance

## Breadcrumb <MyBadge text="Support page config" />

See [Layout → Page → Breadcrumb Section](../layout/page.md#breadcrumb)

## Picture Preview

We supports clicking to preview and zooming the picture, while supporting the sliding browsing of the page picture and the sharing and downloading of the picture too. You can set `themeConfig.photoSwipe` to `false` to disable it.

For more options, please see [photo-swipe plugin configuration][photo-swipe]

## Code Copy

We will add a copy button to the right bottom corner of each code block, which allows you to click and copy the code.

The button is displayed only in desktop mode by default.

For more options, please see [copy-code plugin docs][copy-code]

## Footer Support <MyBadge text="Support page config" />

See [Layout → Page → Footer Section](../layout/page.md#footer-support)
