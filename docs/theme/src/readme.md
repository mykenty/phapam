## Use themes

You can use [vuepress-theme-hope template](https://github.com/Mister-Hope/vuepress-theme-hope-template) directly to start your VuePress journey.

### Install

```bash
npm i -D vuepress-theme-hope
```

Or

```bash
yarn add -D vuepress-theme-hope
```

### Usage

```js
// .vuepress/config.js
const { config } = require("vuepress-theme-hope");

module.exports = config({
  // your config here
});
```

::: tip
The purpose of introducing the `config` function is to give you full hints through TSâ€™s Interface and JSDoc when you edit the configuration.

At the same time, the `config` function will also complete some default configurations for your current configuration which will pass directly to VuePress.

You can view [Config of this site][docs-config] as an example.
